# Key Concepts and Explanations

- **Computing Platform**  
  A combination of hardware and software that together provide an environment in which applications can be executed.

- **Operating System (OS)**  
  System software that manages hardware resources and provides services for running processes efficiently and in an easy-to-use way. It acts as an interface between hardware and user programs.

- **Multiprogramming**  
  Technique where multiple programs are loaded into memory at the same time so the CPU can switch to another when one is waiting, improving utilization.

- **Time Sharing**  
  A scheduling method that gives each user or process a small time slice, creating the illusion that each has its own dedicated machine.

- **Multiprocessing**  
  Using two or more CPUs/processors simultaneously within a single system to execute multiple tasks in parallel.

- **Multithreading**  
  A technique where a single program has multiple threads of execution running concurrently within the same process.

- **Distributed Processing**  
  Splitting computation across multiple computers connected through a network, cooperating to perform a single task.

- **Virtualization**  
  Creating virtual versions of computing resources (OS, servers, storage) to run multiple independent environments on the same physical hardware.

- **Concurrency**  
  The ability of a system to handle multiple tasks that overlap in time, even if they are not executed simultaneously.

- **Persistence**  
  The characteristic of data that outlives the execution of the program that created it, typically stored on disk or in a database.

- **Policy**  
  A set of rules that determine *what* the system should do (e.g., which process gets CPU time).

- **Mechanism**  
  The technical implementation that enforces a policy (e.g., a scheduler that allocates CPU time).

- **Kernel**  
  The core component of an operating system that manages hardware resources, memory, processes, and system calls.
